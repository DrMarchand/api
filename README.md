## Overview

The **Nɛuro-Forge Engine™** is the runtime layer responsible for executing the architecture of **DrMarchand’s ∞ OS™**.

It coordinates identity, connectors, event processing, and system integrity across the broader system.

This engine supports:

- 🔬 **DrMarchand’s Lab⚛︎ratory™**
- 📚 **DrMarchand’s ⚛︎ Library™**
- 🪑 **DrMarchand’s ☸︎ Workbench™**

All operating under:

- 🌴 **Design Orchard LLC ©**

## System Philosophy

The system is built on three core principles:

### ⚙️ Append-Only Truth
Events are not edited after they are written.  
System state is derived from recorded history.

### 🔐 Identity First
Identity is defined as `(provider, provider_sub)`, not email.

### 🧭 Deterministic Runtime
Commands produce events.  
Events update projections.  
Interfaces reflect projections.

```txt
Command → Event → Projection → Interface
```

The engine does not mutate truth retroactively.  
It processes, records, and derives from what has already occurred.

---

## Core Responsibilities

The **Nɛuro-Forge Engine™** provides:

- 📡 connector orchestration
- 🔐 identity verification
- 📜 event ingestion
- 🧾 append-only ledger storage
- 📊 projection generation
- 🧠 runtime state coordination

---

## Event System

The platform runs on an **append-only event ledger**.

Each action emits an immutable event record.

### Example events

```txt
user.created
oauth.authorized
connector.connect.succeeded

host.boot.completed
host.heartbeat
power.source.changed
power.battery.snapshot

atom.isotope.set
atom.isotope.locked
```

Events are hash-chained to support integrity and traceability.

### Future modules

connectors/             # external system bridges
workbench/              # developer interface
```

---

## Security Model

The engine enforces a strict runtime security posture:

- PKCE OAuth flows
- no client-side refresh tokens
- sandboxed connectors
- HMAC device verification
- AES-256 token storage
- append-only event ledger

Integrity is prioritized throughout the runtime.
